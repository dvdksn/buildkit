# SLSA provenance

BuildKit supports automatic creation of [SLSA Provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance)
attestations for the build process. Provenance attestations record information describing
how your build was performed and is important for tracking the security of your build pipeline.

For example, provenance attestations created by BuildKit include details such as:

- Build parameters and environment.
- Build timestamps.
- Version control metadata for your build sources.
- Build dependencies with their immutable checksums. For example, base images or external URLs used by the build.
- Descriptions of all build steps, with their source and layer mappings.

All provenance generated by BuildKit is wrapped inside [in-toto attestations](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation)
in the [SLSA Provenance format](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2).


To build an image with attached provenance with `buildctl`, use the `attest:provenance` option:

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --opt attest:provenance=
```

You can also specify custom parameters for the provenance:

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --opt attest:provenance=mode=min,inline-only=true
```

Provenance attestations can be attached to build results from all BuildKit exporters.
When the final output format is a container image(`image` or `oci` exporter), provenance is attached
to the image using the [attestation storage](./attestation-storage.md) specification. When creating a
multi-platform image, every single-platform subimage will have its own provenance.

When using the `local` or `tar` exporter, the provenance will be written to a file named `provenance.json`
and exported with your build result.

## Parameters

| Parameter      | Type           | Default          | Description                                                                                                 |

| `builder-id`   | String         |                  | Explicitly set SLSA [`builder.id`](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#builder.id) field                       |
| `reproducible` | `true`,`false` | `false`          | Explicitly set SLSA [`metadata.reproducible`](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#metadata.reproducible) field |

### `mode`

Provenance can be generated in one of two modes: `min` or `max`. By default,
when provenance is enabled, the `mode` parameter will be set to `max`.

In `min` mode, BuildKit generates only the bare minimum amount of provenance,
including:

- Build timestamps
- The frontend used
- The build materials

However, the values of build arguments, the identities of secrets, and rich
layer metadata will not be included. `mode=min` should be safe to set on all
builds, as it does not leak information from any part of the build environment.

In `max` mode, BuildKit generates all of the above, as well as:

- The source Dockerfile, and rich layer metadata with sourcemaps to connect the
  source with the build result
- The values of passed build arguments
- Metadata about secrets and ssh mounts

Wherever possible, you should prefer `mode=max` as it contains significantly
more detailed information for analysis. However, on some builds it may not be
appropriate, as it includes the values of various build arguments and metadata
about secrets - these builds should be refactored to prefer passing hidden
values through secrets wherever possible to prevent unnecessary information
leakage.

### `inline-only`

By default, provenance is by included in all exporters that support
attestations. The `inline-only` parameter allows configuring this behavior, to
only include the provenance results in exporters that support inline content,
specifically only exporters that produce container images.

Since other exporters produce attestations into separate files, in their
filesystems, you may not want to include the provenance in these cases.


## Definition

The provenance format generated by BuildKit is defined by the [SLSA Provenance format](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2).

The following is a selection of fields filled in by BuildKit:

### `builder.id` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#builder.id)

The `builder.id` field is set to the URL of the build, if available. This is value can be set with `builder-id` attestation parameter.

```
    "builder": {
      "id": "https://github.com/docker/buildx/actions/runs/3709599520"
    },
```

### `buildType` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#buildType)

The `buildType` field is set to "https://mobyproject.org/buildkit@v1" can be used to determine the structure of the provenance content.

```
    "buildType": "https://mobyproject.org/buildkit@v1",
```

### `invocation.configSource` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#invocation.configSource)

Describes the config that initialized the build.

```
    "invocation": {
      "configSource": {
        "uri": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit.git#refs/tags/v0.11.0-rc3",
        "digest": {
          "sha1": "4b220de5058abfd01ff619c9d2ff6b09a049bea0"
        },
        "entryPoint": "Dockerfile"
      },
```

For builds that were initialized from a remote context like Git URL or HTTP URL, this structure
defines to URL to the context and its immutable digest. For frontend builds, the `entryPoint` field
defines the path for the Dockerfile that initialized the build (`filename` frontend option).

### `invocation.parameters` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#invocation.parameters)

Describes build inputs that were passed to the build.

```
    "invocation": {
      ...
      "parameters": {
        "frontend": "gateway.v0",
        "args": {
          "build-arg:BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR": "1",
          "label:FOO": "bar",
          "source": "docker/dockerfile-upstream:master",
          "target": "release"
        },
        "secrets": [
          {
            "id": "GIT_AUTH_HEADER",
            "optional": true
          }
          ...
        ],
        "ssh": [],
        "locals": [],
```

- `frontend` defines BuildKit frontend used for the build. Currently, this can be `dockerfile.v0` or `gateway.v0`.
- `args` defines the build arguments passed to the BuildKit frontend. This maps to the `--opt` flag in `buildctl`.
The keys are specific to the frontend the build used. For example, in Dockerfile `build-arg:` and `label:` prefixes are
used for build arguments and labels, and `target` key defines the target stage that was built.
The `source` key defines the source image for the Gateway frontend, if used.
- `secrets` defines the secrets that were used to the build. Note that the actual secret values are not included.
- `ssh` defines the ssh forwards that were used to the build.
- `locals` defines if the build used any local sources.


### `invocation.environment` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#invocation.environment)

```
      "environment": {
        "platform": "linux/amd64"
      }
```

The only value BuildKit currently sets is the `platform` of the current build machine. Note that this is not
necessarily the platform of the build result that can be determined from the `in-toto` subject field.


### `materials` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#materials)

Defines all the external artifacts that were part of the build. These will be URLs to Git repositories
where the source code is coming from, HTTP URLs if you are building from a remote tarball or that you use
with `ADD` command in Dockerfile, or any Docker images that were used during the build. The URLs to
the Docker images will be in [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) format.

All the build materials will include the immutable checksum of the artifact. When building from a
mutable tag, you can use the digest information to determine if the artifact has been updated compared
to when the build ran.

```
    "materials": [
      {
        "uri": "pkg:docker/alpine@3.17?platform=linux%2Famd64",
        "digest": {
          "sha256": "8914eb54f968791faf6a8638949e480fef81e697984fba772b3976835194c6d4"
        }
      },
      {
        "uri": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit.git#refs/tags/v0.11.0",
        "digest": {
          "sha1": "4b220de5058abfd01ff619c9d2ff6b09a049bea0"
        }
      }
      ...
    ],
```

### `buildConfig` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#buildConfig)

Describes all the build steps performed during the build.

BuildKit internally uses LLB definition to execute the build steps. The LLB definition of the build steps
is defined in `buildConfig.llbDefinition` field.

Each LLB step is the JSON definition of the [LLB ProtoBuf API](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/v0.10.0/solver/pb/ops.proto).
The dependencies for a vertex in the LLB graph can be found in the `inputs` field for every step.

```
  "buildConfig": {
      "llbDefinition": [
        {
          "id": "step0",
          "op": {
            "Op": {
              "exec": {
                "meta": {
                  "args": [
                    "/bin/sh",
                    "-c",
                    "go build ."
                  ],
                  "env": [
                    "PATH=/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
                    "GOPATH=/go",
                    "GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor",
                  ],
                  "cwd": "/src",
                },
                "mounts": [...]
              }
            },
            "platform": {...},
          },
          "inputs": [
            "step8:0",
            "step2:0",
          ]
        },
        ...
```

### `metadata.buildIncocationId` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#metadata.buildIncocationId)

Unique identifier for the build invocation. Then building a multi-platform image with a single build request,
this value will be the same for all the single-platform subimages.

```
    "metadata": {
      "buildInvocationID": "rpv7a389uzil5lqmrgwhijwjz",
```

### `metadata.buildStartedOn` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#metadata.buildStartedOn)

Timestamp when the build started.

```
      "buildStartedOn": "2021-11-17T15:00:00Z",
```

### `metadata.buildFinishedOn` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#metadata.buildFinishedOn)

Timestamp when the build finished.

```
      "buildFinishedOn": "2021-11-17T15:01:00Z",
```

### `metadata.completeness` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#metadata.completeness)

Defines if the provenance information is complete.

`completeness.parameters` is true if all the build arguments are included in the `invocation.parameters` field.
When building with `min` mode, the build arguments are not included in the provenance information and parameters
are not complete. Parameters are also not complete on direct LLB builds that did not use a frontend.

`completeness.environment` is always true for BuildKit builds.

`completeness.materials` is true if `materials` field includes all the dependencies of the build. When building
from untracked source in a local directory, the materials are not complete, while when building from a remote
Git repository all materials can be tracked by BuildKit and `completeness.materials` is true. 

`https://mobyproject.org/buildkit@v1#hermetic` is a custom field that is true if the build was hermetic and
did not access the network. In Dockerfiles, a build is hermetic if it does not use `RUN` commands or disables
network with `--network=none` flag.

```
      "completeness": {
        "parameters": true,
        "environment": true,
        "materials": true,
        "https://mobyproject.org/buildkit@v1#hermetic": true
      }
    }
```

### `metadata.reproducible` [(SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#metadata.reproducible)

Defines if the build result is supposed to be byte-by-byte reproducible. This value can be set by the
user with the `reproducible=true` attestation parameter.

```
    "reproducible": false
```

### `metadata.https://mobyproject.org/buildkit@v1#metadata`

This extension field defines BuildKit-specific additional metadata that is not part of the SLSA provenance spec.

`source` defines the source mapping of LLB build steps defined in `buildConfig.llbDefinition` to their
original source code (for example Dockerfile commands). `source.locations` contains the ranges of all the
Dockerfile commands that were executed by a LLB step. `source.infos` array contains the source code itself.
This mapping is present if the BuildKit frontend provided it when creating the LLB definition.

`layers` defines the layer mapping of LLB build step mounts defined in `buildConfig.llbDefinition` to the
OCI descriptors of equivalent layers. This mapping is present if the layer data was available, usually
when attestation is for an image or if the build step pulled in image data as part of the build.

`vcs` defines the optional metadata for the version control system that was used for the build. If a build
uses a remote context from Git repository, BuildKit can extract the details of the version control system
automatically and present it in the `invocation.configSource` field. But if the build uses a source from a
local directory, the VCS information is lost even if the directory contained a Git repository. In this case,
the build client can send additional `vcs:source` and `vcs:revision` build options and BuildKit will add
them to the provenance attestations as extra metadata. Note that contrary to the `invocation.configSource`
field, these values were not verified by BuildKit and should not be trusted other than for a metadata hint.

```bash
buildctl build \
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \
    --local context=. \
    --local dockerfile=. \
    --opt attest:provenance= \
    --opt vcs:source=https://github.com/moby/buildkit \
    --opt vcs:revision=0c9b5aeb269c740650786ba77d882b0259415ec7
```

## Output

To inspect the provenance that was generated and attached to a container
image, you can use the `docker buildx imagetools` command to explore the
resulting image in your registry, following the format described in the
[attestation storage](./attestation-storage.md).

For example, for a simple Docker image based on `alpine:latest`, we might get
the following provenance for a `mode=min` build:

```json
